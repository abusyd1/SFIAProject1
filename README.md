# MyUnited
### _A site showcases the Man Utd team, alongside their ratings._


## Project Brief
According to the project specification, the objective of this project is to 'create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies, and tehcnologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.' CRUD is an accronym which stands for 'Create, Read, Update, Delete' - these features should be implemented within the application as well as encapsulating the following throughout the duration of the project:

* Kanban board
* ERD Diagrams
* CI Pipeline
* Relational database with minimum 2 tables
* Design documentation including README file which covers all relevant content
* Risk Assessment
* Python Programming
* Fully designed test suites with high test coverage
* Front end design with Flask and HTML
* Version Control with Git
* CI Server with Jenkins
* Use of a Cloud Server GCP

In my project, I will try to create a application which showcases a football team (Manchester United), where the user can view all players, read their current ratings as well as update ratings, update/add players to the team & delete a player from the team or rating from a player.
