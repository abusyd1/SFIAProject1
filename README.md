# Football Transfer Cenral
### _A site showcasing Football teams, with the ability to add new teams, and add players to those teams._


## Project Brief
According to the project specification, the objective of this project is to 'create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies, and tehcnologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.' CRUD is an accronym which stands for 'Create, Read, Update, Delete' - these features should be implemented within the application as well as encapsulating the following throughout the duration of the project:

* Kanban board
* ERD Diagrams
* CI Pipeline
* Relational database with minimum 2 tables
* Design documentation including README file which covers all relevant content
* Risk Assessment
* Python Programming
* Fully designed test suites with high test coverage
* Front end design with Flask and HTML
* Version Control with Git
* CI Server with Jenkins
* Use of a Cloud Server GCP

In my project, I will try to create a application which showcases football teams, where the user can view these teams, add new teams, view players within the teams, and edit or delete players from the teams.

The main tools that I used to create the application include Flask micro-framework (Python Based), Jinja2, mySQL. Flask was ideal for this small project as there are many extensions such as FlaskSQLAlchemy which I also used in the project. In the 'requirements.txt' file, all extextensions used can be seen. 

## Initial Project Planning
To begin with, I used a KANBAN board to organise and visualise tasks throughout the duration of the project. My inital KANBAN board can be seen below:
